    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">Welcome, I'm Zach.</p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">
      I've worked with JavaScript & TypeScript & SQL - along with several other languages
      - and a number of its libraries and frameworks, for over half a decade and as my
      programming skills grow so does my passion and curiosity for containerization
      (docker and kubernetes) and cloud and database development, as well as data
      visualization. Professionally, I've been living in the headless CMS world and have
      taken a strong interest in structured content and the JamStack. I like to teach and
      demonstrate the knowledge I have gained during my time as a developer. I also like
      long single file components written in tsx within Vue 3.x and React Native repos and
      really fancy as many functional components I can write until I'm lost. I intend to
      learn Rust and/or C++ and work with embedded systems; I've read a lot of the docs
      and followed a few tutorials on the 2 lower-level languages but have not yet had the
      chance yet to truly delve into them.

      When I'm not learning and experimenting with the latest and greatest technologies,
      building sites with TypeScript and GraphQL and Rest APIs, I'm usually either
      studying and completing coding challenges on sites like LeetCode or on the golf
      course ( I'm currently between a 6 and 4 handicap ) working on my game, playing
      fantasy sports or spending time with my lovely wife, Alicia. I was also a published
      fiction writer many moons ago and hope to delve back into writing fiction one of
      these days but for now it's only non-fiction script tags for me. To learn more about
      me you can find my resume on
